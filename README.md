# AutoHotKey scripts

Some convenient Auto Hot Key scripts I've assembled/written for making Windows a little easier to use.
Credit due to original sources cited in comments.


## Install
Clone repo to a semi-permenant location, and make sure AutoHotkey is in your path.

Run [open_startup_folder.bat](https://github.com/gaulinmp/AutoHotKey/blob/master/open_startup_folder.bat) 
  and create a shortcut to [start.bat](https://github.com/gaulinmp/AutoHotKey/blob/master/start.bat)
  in this folder (right click drag into Startup folder).
If you have other scripts you want to run, just add them to `start.bat`.

An alternative method would be copy all the scripts into one big `.ahk` file.
